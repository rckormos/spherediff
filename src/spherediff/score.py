    """Compute the score function from the diffusion kernel on the n-D sphere.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The dimensionality of the space in which the spherical surface is 
        embedded.
    x : np.array [N x n]
        The n-dimensional unit vectors at which to compute the score.
    mean : np.array [N x n]
        The n-dimensional unit vectors to be used as the means of the 
        distributions according to which to compute the score.
    var : np.array [N] 
        Scalar variances of the distributions for each vector.
    hemisphere : bool
        If True, sample on the n-hemisphere instead of the n-sphere.

    Returns
    -------
    score : np.array [N x n]
        The score function evaluated at each point x.
